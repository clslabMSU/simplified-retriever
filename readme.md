##**simplified-retriever**

Large language models (LLMs) have shown improved accuracy in phenotype term normalization tasks when augmented with retrievers that suggest candidate matches based on semantic similarity.

In this project, we introduce a simplified retriever that enhances LLM performance by searching the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) for candidate matches using contextual word embeddings from BioBERT ‚Äî without requiring explicit term definitions.

When tested on phenotype terms extracted from the clinical synopses in *Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM¬Æ)*, we observed that normalization accuracy with GPT-4o increased from a baseline of **62%** (no augmentation) to **85%** with retriever augmentation.

This approach is generalizable to other biomedical term normalization tasks and offers an efficient alternative to more complex retrieval pipelines.

## üì¶ Setup

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the required spaCy model (if using the spaCy-based script):

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```

If using the GPT-based normalization script, set your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```
